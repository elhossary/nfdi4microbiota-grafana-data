It has been found to be crucial for immunologic, hormonal and metabolic homeostasis of its host. In this workshop, we aim to not only introduce you to the all the necessary basic methods to analyse a microbiome experiment, like processing your raw data, statistical testing and quality control. Additionally, we want to introduce you to Qiita, a microbial study management platform used to manage and compute studies with microbiome data. This framework establishes an easily accessible way for non-computational scientists to analyse their own data with the option of using pre-defined workflows or building their own. Afterwards, we will explore the microbiome analysis pipeline QIIME2 to delve further into our data sets and to enable you to be able to take your first steps towards your own analysis.

6670382cd1af7132002f	Introduction to R	"The workshop offers an introduction to the software ""R"". Increasingly, physicians and biologists are facing large amounts of data that can no longer be analysed ""by hand”. The R environment offers free software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It thus allows handling of large data amounts, simplifies the interpretation of the data, or enables a deeper analysis.
Agenda:

Mon, May 6, 10am–4pm 
 Programming basics, including syntax, data types, using R studio, importing and exporting data, and data wrangling techniques.  
 

Tue, May 7, 9am–4pm 
Data analysis techniques in R, including correlation analysis, statistical tests, and creating visually appealing graphs using ggplot2. 
 

Wed, May 8, 9am–1pm  
Apply the concepts learned in the previous days to real-world sequencing and SNP data analysis, including creating heatmaps. 
 

If there is enough interest one can add a session to discuss one\'s own research/project and how to use R for it.  
 

Learning goals 
The goal of this seminar is to provide participants with little or no prior knowledge of working with R data the opportunity to fill in any knowledge gaps they may have and determine whether R can be used in their own research. The topic ranges from basic knowledge to get started to more advanced examples, where you see in real-world research examples how to use R.  
 

Prerequisites: 
None 
 

Language:

6682e41682747da34ff3	A practical introduction to bioinformatics and RNA-seq using Galaxy	"This practical introduction to bioinformatics will explain key concepts of sequencing data analysis as well as provide a broader overview on bioinformatics data analysis.\r\nData analysis is a job in high demand. As early as 2012, a Harvard Business Review article declared data science the “sexiest job of the 21st century”, and it remains an excellent career choice in “2022 and beyond”. Furthermore, a study of the healthcare job market during COVID-19 clearly showed a shift towards analytical skills as a requirement in new job offers.\r\n\r\nRNA-seq has revolutionised genomics and health care research by being a high-throughput and comparatively low-cost method. Along with the development of computational tools for its analysis, RNA-seq has fundamentally improved our understanding of RNA biology.\r\n\r\nGalaxy is a global open-source project with the European Galaxy server being the largest instance in Europe, serving more than 70,000 users. The Freiburg Galaxy Team hosts this server out of Freiburg. Through Galaxy as a gateway, we offer free access to databases and more than 3,200 bioinformatics tools which can be used through a graphical user interface. In this workshop, you will learn how to use Galaxy and how to perform a complete RNA-seq data analysis. However, RNA-seq data is just one of many different kinds of data analysed in bioinformatics.

66fd580ee058b2d33370	NFDI4Microbiota and DZIF: Linux basics and scripting for bioinformatics	"Increasingly, physicians and biologists are facing large amounts of data, that can no longer be analyzed ""by hand"". In many research fields, bioinformatics contributes both general and specific algorithms implemented in software packages that simplify the interpretation of the data, or allow a deeper analysis.

Often, bioinformatics software lacks a user-friendly graphical interface. The success of programs such as BLAST or BWA shows, however, that this does not have to be an obstacle. While the use of command line tools at first sight might appear complicated, it provides excellent opportunities to automate repetitive tasks and analysis steps into pipelines. 

The aim of the workshop ""Linux basics and scripting for bioinformatics"" is to lay a foundation for this automated application of (bioinformatics) programs for the participants. Accordingly, interested biologists and physicians and other people interested, are invited to participate in a hands-on, in-person workshop, where they can become familiar with the Linux environment and its associated landscape, using common bioinformatics tools as examples for creating shell scripts. The last day of the workshop will cover the fundamentals of the Slurm job scheduler, specifically as used in the HZI cluster, although this material is generally applicable. There will also be time available to allow participants to discuss their own bioinformatics problems. 

The course assumes no Linux knowledge, and will be taught in English. All participants will receive a certificate of attendance. 

The course will be held in the BRICS building (Rebenring 56, 38106 Braunschweig) between Tuesday 26th – Thursday 28th November 2024.

The microbiome has been found to be crucial for immunologic, hormonal and metabolic homeostasis of its host. In this workshop, we aim to not only introduce you to the all the necessary basic methods to analyse a microbiome experiment, like processing your raw data, statistical testing and quality control. We also want to practice these computational techniques in interactive hands-on sessions. On the second day, we want to introduce you to visual applications for research analysis. First, we will introdcue Qiita, a microbial study management platform used to manage and compute studies with microbiome data. This framework establishes an easily accessible way for non-computational scientists to analyse their own data with the option of using pre-defined workflows or building their own. The different options on how to utilize the previously learned basics in Qiita will be explored in further hands-on sessions. Afterwards, we're going to focus on WGS metagenomics data, where several recent approaches tackling the problem of taxonomic assignment will be presented. Finally, the MGX framework will be introduced, a modern graphical application that allows researchers to perform taxonomic and functional classification without the need for any programming expertise or large-scale compute resources.

67a6194e2d03405d7146	Introduction to Genome Annotation	This session laid the groundwork for anyone new to the fundamental process of genome annotation. We covered the key steps of identifying coding sequences (CDSs), non-coding RNAs, regulatory elements, and assigning putative functions to genes. Students were introduced to popular tools (e.g., Prokka, RAST) and databases (NCBI, UniProt) used in automated annotation pipelines. We discussed the importance of accurate gene prediction, including the pitfalls of short or fragmented assemblies and how to address them. Interactive examples demonstrated the annotation process—from raw genomic sequence to a functionally annotated genome—highlighting how annotations inform downstream analyses like metabolic reconstructions and comparative genomics. Topics such as database curation, annotation consistency, and manual verification were also addressed, emphasizing their role in producing high-quality, reproducible results. By the end, participants understood how genome annotation underpins nearly all genomic and metagenomic investigations, forming a crucial link between sequencing data and biological interpretation.

67a6199443dee8e5fe01	Using SQL for Omics datasets	This workshop highlighted Structured Query Language (SQL) as a powerful tool for organizing, querying, and analyzing large-scale omics datasets. Participants learned how to design relational database schemas tailored to omics data (e.g., linking gene annotations, sample metadata, and experimental parameters). Through practical exercises, they practiced writing basic to intermediate SQL queries—SELECT, JOIN, GROUP BY—to extract actionable insights from complex, multi-table databases. We also covered best practices for database management, including normalization, indexing, and data integrity constraints. Examples focused on tasks like retrieving specific gene annotations linked to environmental factors, or quickly summarizing functional profiles across multiple samples. By demonstrating how SQL can enhance reproducibility and collaboration, the session underscored its value in multi-omics research, where data from multiple sources must be efficiently integrated and analyzed. In the end, participants saw how SQL complements other bioinformatics tools, enabling them to handle expanding datasets with greater speed and precision.

67b64998086834db1efb	Introduction to Ancient Metagenomics	"Ancient metagenomics applies cutting-edge metagenomic methods to the degraded DNA content of archaeological and paleontological specimens. The rapidly growing field is currently uncovering a wealth of novel information for both human and natural history, from identifying the causes of devastating pandemics such as the Black Death, to revealing how past ecosystems changed in response to long-term climatic and anthropogenic change, to reconstructing the microbiomes of extinct human relatives. However, as the field grows, the techniques, methods, and workflows used to analyse such data are rapidly changing and improving.

In this summer school (block praktikum) we will go through the main steps of ancient metagenomic bioinformatic workflows, familiarising students with the command line, demonstrating how to process next-generation-sequencing (NGS) data, and showing how to perform de novo metagenomic assembly. Focusing on host-associated ancient metagenomics, the course consists of a combination of lectures and hands-on exercises, allowing participants to become familiar with the types of questions and data researchers work with. Round table discussions with experts at each stage of the workflow will be held to allow participants to get advice on their own projects and research.

By the end of the course, participants will have an understanding of how to effectively carry out the major bioinformatic components of an ancient metagenomic project in an open and transparent manner."

67c9ce72558b73670386	Hands-on Biometadata: How to describe biological data? primer to a FAIR approach for now and future	"Current good science practices require to correctly label the data produced in modern biology. Not only do these labels give context and interpretation during data analysis, but they also allow interoperability between different investigations and potential reanalyses. However, the process of describing your data thoroughly, i.e. adding correct metadata, is not straightforward and can be confusing. <br>
<br>

After this workshop you will... <br>
- have prepared the necessary metadata to ease the upload of your data to a repository of your choice. <br>
- know how to describe your datasets in a FAIR manner which ensures that your uploaded data is findable and re-usable by machines and humans for big data analysis and comparable results by you and others. <br>
- be able to select terms based on existing ontologies and controlled vocabulary (to increase future machine-actionable analysis). <br>
- be knowledgeable on how to suggest new (machine-actionable) terms. <br>
- have discussed with peers about struggles with the repository requirements on metadata upload and found solutions. <br>

681db92d363220724880	Introduction to R - NFDI4Microbiota and DZIF Training Course 2025	"The workshop offers an introduction to the software ""R"". Increasingly, physicians and biologists are facing large amounts of data that can no longer be analysed ""by hand”. The R environment offers free software facilities for data manipulation, calculation and graphical display. It thus allows handling of large data amounts, simplifies the interpretation of the data, or enables a deeper analysis.

The aim of this seminar is to give participants with little or no experience of working with R the opportunity to close their knowledge gaps and determine whether R can be used in their own research. Topics range from the basics for getting started to advanced examples of using R in practical research.  

This course is suitable for people who are not familiar with R.

Registration deadline is on 06 June 2025.

The number of participants is limited, apply soon to avoid disappointment.
The workshop is in high demand, if you are admitted to the course but do not show up without canceling, you will be blacklisted."

You will learn how to process amplicon sequencing data to generate accurate microbiota diversity and composition readouts for your projects. Template data will be provided but, if available, you will be able to process your own data sets. The course includes detailed theoretical information and practical sessions on your own computer. <br>
<br>
Requirements: <br>
No prior knowledge in bioinformatics is required. Own computer will be needed. A configuration such as CPU 2.40 GHz, 8GB RAM, Windows 7, 64 Bit works well. Less will do, but the analysis might take longer on an old machine.<br>

68a30ef8d6c9a3eb6191	GSC standards, where to find them and how to use them	Standardised and well annotated metadata are a cornerstone of the FAIR data principles. In this workshop, we will begin with the metadata standards developed and maintained by the Genomic Standards Consortium (GSC), which provides checklists and extensions for a variety of environments and biomes. We will then zoom in on the minimal metadata standards for environmental and biological context proposed by the NFDI4Microbiota consortium, built on the GSC framework. Next, you’ll learn how to choose biome-specific ontologies and use the Ontology Lookup Service (OLS) to annotate your metadata, including how to record the value NULL.

68a30fd8f3d3817d1376	Using the virus database VirJenDB to access metadata and sequences for bioinformatics analyses	Virus research depends on accurate sequence and metadata, but is often hampered by errors in user-submitted data and a lack of standardized metadata practices. Viral genomes are small and highly variable and current challenges in their organization are compounded by inconsistencies in related metadata (e.g., taxonomy, segment nomenclature, lifecycle definitions). VirJenDB (VJDB; virjendb.org) aims to provide a platform to address these challenges with a metadata-driven, integrative virus sequence database. Virus metadata and sequences from primary and secondary sources such as NCBI Virus, ENA, BVBRC, and community standards like MIGS-VI and ENA Sample Checklists have been merged and harmonized into an integrated dataset. The integrated dataset is used to enable development of metadata schema extensions and through different applications supports virus researchers throughout the data lifecycle. The VJDB dataset is accessible through the web portal, and provides input to bioinformatics webtools (future feature). In this demo, we will start with an overview of virus resources and demonstrate how to use currently available features of the VJDB portal: searching and refining results, downloading data, and exploring metadata schemas. Note that the demo content is subject to change depending on user demands.

68a3102522a4fb9d27ab	Identifying Identifiers: Harnessing StrainInfo’s tools to find and resolve strain designations in li	Extracting meaningful biological entities (e.g. sequence accession numbers and species names) from unstructured text is an essential yet complex task. In microbiology, the identification is further complicated by the use of different designations (e.g. DSM 20543 and LMG 28910) for the same strain. Learn how to identify strain designations in literature and sequence metadata by leveraging StrainInfo's API and libraries. A workshop ideal for bioinformaticians, data scientists and researchers with a beginner-level understanding of Python, where participants will be guided through hands-on exercises. By the end of the workshop, attendees will have written a script capable of extracting strain identifiers from both literature and sequence metadata. This script will utilize the StrainInfo API to identify these strains and collect key information such as alternative designations, type strain status, taxonomy and more.
